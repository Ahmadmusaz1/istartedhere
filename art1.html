Development of the Sciences of Ḥadīth (ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth/Muṣtalaḥ al-Ḥadīth)
During the lifetime of the Prophet PBUH and after his death, his Companions
(Ṣaḥābah) used to refer to him when quoting his sayings. The Successors (ṭābiʿūn) followed
suit; some of them used to quote the Prophet PBUH through the Companions while others
would omit the intermediate authority; such a ḥadīth is known as mursal (fast-forwarded). It
was found that, the missing link between the Successor and the Prophet PBUH might be one
person, i.e. a Companion, or two persons, the extra person being an older Successor, who
heard the ḥadīth from the Companion. This is an example of how the need for the verification
of each isnad arose (At-Tahhan, 2017, p. 3). As time passed, more reporters were involved in
each isnad, and so the situation demanded strict discipline in the acceptance of ahadith; the
science regulating this discipline is known as musṭalaḥ al-ḥadīth (the terminologies of ḥadīth).
Therefore, muṣtalah books speak of a number of classes of ḥadīth in accordance with their
statuses (Al-Tahhan, 2017, p. 3).
In this regard, a lot of books were authored in this field. As for the first generation,
they did not write on muṣtalaḥ or ʿilm al-rijāl in general, rather, at the beginning, they included
discussions on some of its branches in their books, like Imam Muslim (d. 261 H) in his book
al-Tamyiz, and the preface of his Sahih (3-34), and al-Tirmidhi (d.279 H) in his ‘Ilal. Also, among
the earliest available works in this field are Tarikh of Ibn Ma'in (d. 233), Tabaqat of Khalifa b.
Khayyat (d. 240H), Tarikh of Bukhari (d. 256), Kitab al-Jarh wa al-Ta'dil of Ibn Abi Hatim (d. 327H)
and Tabaqat of Muhammad bin Saad al-Zuhri (d. 320)(Al-Tahhan, 2017, p. 4). However,
according to Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Abu Muhammad al-Ramahurmuzi (d.365H) was the first to write
solely on muṣtalaḥ al-ḥadīth, followed by Hakim (d. 405 H), and Khatib al-Bagdhadi (d. 463) and
then followed by Abu Amr Ibn Salah with his comprehensive work “Muqaddimah” (Ibn Hajar,
Nuzhat al-Nadhar, 1422, pp. 30-34). Works on muṣtalaḥul ḥadīth were fully developed after Ibn
Salah, a lot of works were carried out by different Scholars such as Imam Nawawi (d. 676H),
al-Dhahabi (d.748H), Ibn Hajar (d.852H), al-Sakhawi (d.902H), al-Suyuti (d.911H) among
others.
Historically, by the middle of the 3rdcentury AH/9thcentury CE, the ḥadīth had taken
definite form, had established almost all its detailed contents, and completely won the field.
In order to collect, sift and systematize this massive and amazing product, a number of
eminent scholars began to travel throughout the length and breadth of the then Muslim
world. This powerful movement is known as ‘Seeking of the ḥadīth. By the end of the
3rd/beginning of the 10thcentury, several collections had been produced, six of which have,
since then, been regarded as being especially authoritative and are known as ‘The Six
Genuine Ones’ (Sihah Kutub al-Sittah)” (Falahi, p. 10). By this time, a quite number of the
sciences of ḥadīth were in place to preserve the sanctuary of ḥadīth, such as the science of
tabaqat (chronology) with some contributions from Muhammad bn Saad, Khalifa b. Khayyat
among others. The science of validation (al-Jarh wal Taadil), Tarikh, Maarifat al-Sahaabah, al-
Asami wa al-Kuna, al-Munfaridat wa al-Wuhdaan, al-Ilal among others.
Furthermore, Falahi observes that, at the time of the Prophet PBUH, the Companions
were zealous to learn and recall his words and the incidents of his life.
